# Locale-Storage-Manager-JSX

The `LocalStorageManager` is a React component designed to manage key-value pairs in the browser's local storage. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, removing, and copying local storage items.

## Setup

To use `LocalStorageManager` in your React application, simply copy the component code into your project. Then, import and use the `LocalStorageManager` component in your application as follows:

```jsx
import LocalStorageManager from './path/to/LocalStorageManager';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <LocalStorageManager />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Use Cases
Adding New Key-Value Pairs: Easily add new items to the local storage.
Updating Existing Items: Update the value of existing local storage items.
Removing Items: Delete items from the local storage.
Copying Values to Clipboard: Quickly copy the values of local storage items to the clipboard.
Viewing All Local Storage Items: Display all key-value pairs currently stored in the local storage.
How It Works
Step-by-Step Guide
Initialization: On component mount, useEffect is used to load existing local storage data into the component's state.

Displaying Local Storage Items: All local storage items are displayed in a list. Each item has options to edit, copy, or remove.

Adding/Updating Items:

To add a new item, enter a key in the 'Add a custom key' input field and its corresponding value in the 'Value' field, then click 'Add/Update'.
To update an existing item, click 'Edit' next to the item, modify the value, and then click 'Save'.
Editing Items: When 'Edit' is clicked, the component enters the editing mode for the selected key. The value field is populated with the current value for the key, which can be edited.

Saving Changes: Clicking 'Save' updates the local storage with the new value for the selected key.

Removing Items: Click 'Remove' to delete the key-value pair from local storage.

Copying Values: Click 'Copy' to copy the value of a local storage item to the clipboard.

State Management: The component uses React's useState to manage local storage data, selected keys, and input values.

Styling
The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Adjust the class names as needed to match your application's design.
